## Guidelines for Search Query Generation

1. **Use Key Terms**: Extract specific entities, technical terms, and concepts from user input
2. **Add Context**: Include domain-specific terminology related to the agent capability  
3. **Multiple Angles**: Cover different aspects (definitions, interactions, procedures, precedents)
4. **Combine Concepts**: Mix user's specific terms with broader category terms
5. **Professional Language**: Use terminology that would appear in authoritative sources

## Chain of Thought Process

For each user input:

1. **Key Extraction**: What are the most important terms and concepts?
2. **Information Needs**: What would I need to know to answer this comprehensively?
3. **Search Strategy**: What queries would find the most relevant, authoritative information?
4. **Diversity**: Do my queries cover different aspects without too much overlap?
