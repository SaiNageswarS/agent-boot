**User Input**: {{.USER_INPUT}}

**Think through this step by step:**

1. First, determine if the user input is relevant to the agent capability
2. If relevant, extract key concepts and terms from the input
3. Reason about what information would be needed to answer the question
4. Generate diverse search queries combining user terms with domain expertise
5. If not relevant, explain why and return empty queries

Provide your reasoning and then the JSON output.
